# The Shoppies
This is my Shopify Winter 2021 Internship application challenge.

## Usage
You can access this app through https://bmazerolle.github.io/the-shoppies/ or run it locally by downloading the source code and running _npm start_

Search for movies via the search bar, and nominate them by pressing the green nominate button in the returned movie list. Movies can be un-nominated by pressing that button a second time, or by pressing the red x button above the movie title in the nominations flyout. The nominations flyout can be accessed by pressing the arrow on the right hand side of the screen, where you can see your currently nominated movies. 

Users can also access the movie's IMDB page by clicking on the movie title in the results list or the nomination flyout.

Nominations are persisted via a cookie. Maximum 5 nominations, an alert is given if the user attempts to nominate 6 movies.
